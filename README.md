# linux_process_injection_example
This project demonstrates how to inject shellcode into a running process using ptrace on Linux. It includes features such as memory region analysis, shellcode injection, and process control. Intended for educational purposes only. Licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL v3).

# Code Injection Example
This is an educational project demonstrating how to inject code into another process using **ptrace** in Linux. The program identifies executable regions in memory, injects shellcode, and modifies process registers to execute it.

**Disclaimer**: This project is for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Features
- Identifies executable regions of a target process.
- Injects custom shellcode.
- Demonstrates process control using `ptrace`.
